# slack-automation

This is a Slack Bot that can post, delete, schedule, and listen to the messages,and send attachments.  

In order to automate the bot, you need to create the Slack app, add permissions, and set up event listener. 
For the purposes of this tutorial I used ngrok (https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) server service. Once you have an app, scopes(permissions), and event listenter ready, we can initialize new node.js project by running npm init.
Here is the link to the tutorial: https://slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started-http#setting-up-events-with-http

Also, you can use web api package to initialize the bot that will perform specific task.
